### A little about me

- Physics background, Started coding in FORTRAN, then Fortran and C
- Realized that I love programming with Perl
- Switched to Python for its scientific stack, and better object support
- switched to Go for the speeeeeed!

What kind of programming language is Go?

- Strong, static types
- Enforced by a **very** fast compiler
- Garbage collected
- Concurrency supported at the language level, in the style of [Communicating Sequential Processes](http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf)
- Functional programming facilities
- Object oriented programming facilities
- Very opinionated about... everything.
